            The purpose of this research is to examine how people break
            down complex problems into smaller pieces. The study will
            involve arranging blocks to match specified shapes.
            It will take approximately 30 minutes to
            complete, and you will receive $5.

            There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in
            this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to
            those you would ordinarily experience from viewing a computer
            monitor and using a mouse or keyboard for a similar amount of
            time.
            <!-- At the end of the study, we will provide an explanation of
            the questions that motivate this line of research and will
            describe the potential implications. -->

          <p>
            Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you
            may refuse to participate or you may choose to withdraw at any
            time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are
            otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study will remain
            confidential. No personally identifiable information will be
            associated with your data.
            <!-- Also, all analyses of the data will be
            averaged across all the participants, so your individual responses
            will never be specifically analyzed. -->
